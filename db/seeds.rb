However, in the near future they will be sponsoring a new exhibit, called Reusable Universes, that will feature artwork created by the contemporary artist, Shih Chieh Huang. This new exhibit will need corresponding interactive activities, provided by the WAM, to allow visitors to become more involved. Huang takes inspiration from early technology such as computer cooling fans, basic circuit boards, and even simpler objects; such as power strips, in order to create his sculptures. His views of these everyday objects differ from those of the public and our understanding of his creative process can only be developed so far through text. In order for viewers to truly grasp the thoughts and concepts that go into his work, Huang has set out to bring his artistic process to life and put on a show featuring himself creating one of his sculptures. He plans to highlight the meaning of each object through the location and orientation he chooses as the audience observes how he brings his art to life. Working alongside the WAM, Huang will be able to give the audience enough information and examples of his work to develop a true appreciation of his art style.", budget: "#{budget_generator}", location: "#{location_generator}", status: "open", max_members: 2, user: dummy2)

  People are at once a celebrated and reviled pastime. From humble beginnings as a vandal‚Äôs crime in New York City, street art has evolved to become globally accepted. Artists like Shepard Fairey and JR have seen their work attract attention in political campaigns and high society. However, art can still be considered vandalism in many cases in the U.S. and around the world. This was proven in last year‚Äôs destruction of the iconic 5 Pointz in Queens. The street art initiative by Shanaya provides a safe haven for these masterfully creative works.
  
  One of the most important features is that the people are shown in their natural habitat, so the viewer can truly understand the space the art creates (quite an improvement over putting a Banksy piece in an auction).

binary = Project.new(title: "Sketch of Binary Perception", description: "2020 was a particularly hard year for the trans and non-binary community. Not only were we struck by the morbid, isolating restrictions of lockdown, but we faced increasing global violence (particularly against trans people of colour), transphobic tirades, and the implementation of devastating policy by Liz Truss.

Now, against the advice of healthcare professionals, court orders have halted puberty blockers being given out at The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (the London-based Gender Identity Development Service), thereby restricting the access of these drugs to under-16 trans youths. Amid this backdrop of hostility, violence, prejudice, and isolation a group of artists came together during lockdown to resiliently forge a creative trans community. 

Trans healthcare charity We Exist teamed up with artist studio initiative The Koppel Project to facilitate an artist residency exclusively for trans and non-binary folk. Running from November 2020 to the end of January 2021, the residency provided studio space for 30 creatives in the heart of London. The space was open to trans artists of all creative backgrounds, from dancers and designers to writers and sculptors, covering a wide diversity of gender expressions and identities. 

The residency took place at the abandoned, old campus of Central Saint Martins, a building which birthed such legends as Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Kane. Taking it over in 2016 in order to provide affordable studio spaces and teaching for artists, The Koppel Project's intention is creating ‚Äùa safe, inclusive community for artistic expression and a platform for all emerging makers.‚Äù Whist adhering to social distancing, the space remained open over lockdown, giving these artists a creative haven to make, scavenge, and destroy before the campus‚Äô renovation starts this February. 

In December, photographer Antonio Perricone visited the artists for a series of portraits. Being on location at the eerie old campus set the tone for the shoot. ‚ÄùWandering around this vast empty building on a weekend with very little natural light, the sense of the place‚Äôs creative history hung all around us. We were inspired in part by the scene in Fellini‚Äôs La Dolce Vita where a group of strangers walk around this huge old house together by candlelight,‚Äù Perricone tells Dazed. ‚ÄúEach photograph started with a discussion of the artist‚Äôs practice, looking through the references together, and then picking from Ellie and Eddie's wonderful wardrobe and deciding how the styling and choreography could best express the sitter‚Äôs personality ‚Äî if too much styling or posing didn't feel right we wouldn't go with it. I wanted to show every artist‚Äôs dual vulnerability and strength.‚Äù", budget: "#{budget_generator}", location: "#{location_generator}", status: "open", max_members: 2, user: dummy2)
